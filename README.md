An important aspect of Supply chain management is inventory management  because the cost of inventories in a supply chain accounts for about 30 percent of the value of the product. The main focus of this work is to study the performance of a single-product serial supply chain operating with a base-stock policy and to optimize the inventory levels in the supply chain to minimize the total supply chain cost, comprising holding and shortage costs at all the installations in the supply chain In this project we study the performance of a single-product serial supply chain and decision-making with the aid of Metaheuristic algorithms like Genetic Algorithm, Crow Search Algorithm, and Adaptive gbest - Gravitational Search Algorithm, to compare the results obtained from these three algorithms and to conduct proper assessments.
